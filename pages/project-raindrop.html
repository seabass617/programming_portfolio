            <p class="mini-text"><b id="subheader">Brief: </b>The goal of this project was to build a digital experience centered around the theme of raindrops hitting a puddle of water.</p>
            <p class="mini-text">
              <b id="subheader">Process: </b>Like most of my projects, I started off design with a pen and paper. I established key components, a raindrop object, and a users interactions.
              I first built the raindrop object and its properties, such as location, propogation speed, and radius, then built respective methods to update and display each drop.
              Once I had a simple raindrop working, I moved on to creating a system of raindrops. Upon seeing the system of raindrops, I then focused on polishing off each drop and system settings so that I could get a natural effect. Once an ambient system was built, I asked questions about how this could become interactive without taking away its peaceful nature when untouched? I decided to take a departure from
              my traditional slap a parameter slider and call it "interactive" style and move towards a more aesthetic approach by only allowing for mouse click or touch interactions, which freed the screen of an ugly bits.
            </p>
            <p class="mini-text">
              <b id="subheader">Obstacles: </b> I encoutered a few road blocks during the development of this program. The first was making sure that I wasn't creating raindrop object without destorying them. You don't 
              want to be storing raindrops that don't exist on the screen anymore! To combat this, each raindrop has a lifespan, the program is constantly checking to see if a drop is alive (displayed on the screen),
              and if it isn't, it's removed from the system of raindrops array. Another obstactle was thinking about how to make the raindrops as realistic as possible. It took a little bit of thinking and imagination, but I determinded
              that the idea of dissipation and timing were key elements that stuck out to me when I observed rain. I ended up mapping the opacity of the droplet ripple to its radius so as the drop propogated, it would become fainter, giving this idea of a loss of
              energy. I then looked at the system as a whole and thought about the rate of raindrops falling on the screen. In nature, this rate isn't constant, nor are these different rates totally random. It doesn't just go from a drizzle to a downpour in an
              instant (unless you're in Boston), and even in less drastic situations when a rainfall seems constant, some fluctuation is always present. I addressed this issue by associating the rate of drops falling to a perlin noise range, delivering natural
              randomness over time.

              Armadillidiidae Hirudinea (pillbug leech) was a project focused on the idea of multiples.
              I was inspired by the Ohms from Hayao Miyazaki's film "Naussica of the Valley of the Wind."
              I loved seeing how there was so much emotion held within a creature that was essentially
              a slug with a bunch of eyes. I wanted to work on this idea of containing emotion within
              an insect type creature, something typically viewed by humans as not having feelings. Another 
              aspect I wanted to play with was the idea of an insect colony and the different versions of
              what a community could look like. Which is why I decided to organize as if they were out feeding
              on the surrounding trees and brining nutrients back to their hive. 
            </p>
            <p class="mini-text">
              I originally sculpted the creature out of an oil based modeling clay, then created a mold out of silicon that
              would be supported by a plaster mother mold. I created four molds total and was able to quickly make 50 bugs.

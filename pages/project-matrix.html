            <p class="mini-text">This project was focused on object oriented programming in a creative context. The task was to recreate the "Matrix Rain" effect
              from the movie "The Matrix". We started with the creation of a "character" object, which had a value (the character that it would be), coordinates and fall speed. A character has the ability rain down, and change at a given interval.
              Next, we created a "stream" object which would be comprised of an array of character objects and had the responsibility of populating itself with characters, and rendering every character onto the screen.
            </p>
            <p class="mini-text">At the initiation of the program, the canvas size is defined, then n number of streams are created to fill the screen width. There streams are then stored in an array, until
              the draw function is called. Then each time the draw function is called, all the streams are rendered at their respective locations. Once the basic "rain" design was finished, we focused on making it more believable, by adding a blur effect and making some of the first characters a different color.
            </p>
            <p class="mini-text"> I decided to further work on the code by creating a separate "Character Bank" which allowed for a variety of characters to be used and not just Katana. I ended up adding numbers 
              as it was more realistic to the original Matrix design. I also changed the colors to give it a more unique feel and optimized the sketch to be more responsive and work as a background for a webpage.
              As next steps, I would like to add opcaicity to trailing characters, add some interactivity where the user can change color, speed, size, and I would also like to learn how to optimize it for smoother
              playback. 
            </p>
            <p class="mini-text">This Matrix Simulation was created by following an in depth tutorial given by Emily Xie on Dan Shiffman's youtube channel The Coding Train.</p>

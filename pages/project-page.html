        <p class="mini-text">This project was the product of the "passion project" assignment we recieved in sculpting. The only criteria for the project was that it must
          invole something you are passionate about. I have a passion for cars and wanted to learn how to weld, so I used this as an opportunity to hit both of those interests.
          I knew that in order to cover the passion, I would have to make the piece out of recycled car parts. The piece was inspired by my fascination for repurposed materials
          and character design. I knew that this character, considering that all the pieces would be recycled, would not be a "clean" character. I went to junkyard to get all
          the parts and learned how to weld. The key element to this piece for me was the BMW headlight lens, it was the centerpeice and everything else was added on according to it.
          "Tell more of a story about the character itself... Here lies slumbot, a robot welded together in slums of 2080 Los Angeles, did he lose a battle, was his body taken apart for another creation,
          what has he seen, and what stories does he tell?"
